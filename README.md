# REActivityViewController

Open source alternative to UIActivityViewController, highly customizable and compatible with iOS 5.0.
It allows to create custom activites with ease, you control their apperance and behavior and no longer restricted to single-color icons as with the default `UIActivity`.

### Included activities

All activites are compatible with iOS 5.0.

* Facebook
* Twitter
* VKontakte
* Tubmlr
* Message
* Mail
* Open in Safari
* Save to Pocket
* Save to Instapaper
* Save to Album
* Open in Maps
* Print
* Copy

## Requirements
* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 5.0 or higher
* ARC

If you are not using ARC in your project, add `-fobjc-arc` as a compiler flag for all the files in this project.

## Demo

Build and run the `REActivityViewControllerExample` project in Xcode to see `REActivityViewController` in action.

## Installation

The recommended approach for installating REActivityViewController is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Edit your Podfile and add REActivityViewController:

``` bash
$ edit Podfile
platform :ios, '5.0'
pod 'REActivityViewController', '~> 1.0'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Add `#include "REActivityViewController.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

### Configuring & presenting REActivityViewController

Presenting `REActivityViewController` is easy as 1-2-3. First, prepare activities that you're going to use.
You can create custom activities right here in your code, no need to deal with subclassing or providers as in UIActivityViewController.
Once your activities are ready, prepare data source (userInfo) and present the view controller.

``` objective-c
// Prepare activities
//
REFacebookActivity *facebookActivity = [[REFacebookActivity alloc] init];
RETwitterActivity *twitterActivity = [[RETwitterActivity alloc] init];
REMessageActivity *messageActivity = [[REMessageActivity alloc] init];
RESafariActivity *safariActivity = [[RESafariActivity alloc] init];
RESaveToAlbumActivity *saveToAlbumActivity = [[RESaveToAlbumActivity alloc] init];
REPrintActivity *printActivity = [[REPrintActivity alloc] init];
RECopyActivity *copyActivity = [[RECopyActivity alloc] init];
REMapsActivity *mapsActivity = [[REMapsActivity alloc] init];
REInstagramActivity *instagramActivity = [[REInstagramActivity alloc] init];

// Compile activities into an array, we will pass that array to
// REActivityViewController on the next step
//
NSArray *activities = @[facebookActivity, twitterActivity, messageActivity, saveToAlbumActivity, safariActivity, mapsActivity, instagramActivity, printActivity, copyActivity];

// Create REActivityViewController controller and assign data source
//
REActivityViewController *activityViewController = [[REActivityViewController alloc] initWithViewController:self activities:activities];
activityViewController.userInfo = @{
    @"image": [UIImage imageNamed:@"Flower.jpg"],
    @"text": @"Hello world!",
    @"url": [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://github.com/romaonthego/REActivityViewController"],
    @"coordinate": @{@"latitude": @(37.751586275), @"longitude": @(-122.447721511)}
};

// Present it using current context
//
self.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationCurrentContext;
[self presentViewController:activityViewController animated:YES completion:^{
    self.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationFullScreen;
}];
```

### iPad specific

On iPad, you should use `UIPopoverController` to present `REActivityViewController`.
`_popoverViewController` property of UIViewController is still a private API (sigh), so we'll need to pass it manually:
`activityViewController.presentingPopoverController = _activityPopoverController;`

``` objective-c
// Create REActivityViewController controller and assign data source
//
REActivityViewController *activityViewController = [[REActivityViewController alloc] initWithViewController:self activities:activities];
    @"image": [UIImage imageNamed:@"Flower.jpg"],
    @"text": @"Hello world!",
    @"url": [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://github.com/romaonthego/REActivityViewController"],
    @"coordinate": @{@"latitude": @(37.751586275), @"longitude": @(-122.447721511)}
};

_activityPopoverController = [[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewController:activityViewController];
activityViewController.presentingPopoverController = _activityPopoverController;
[_activityPopoverController presentPopoverFromBarButtonItem:self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem
                                   permittedArrowDirections:UIPopoverArrowDirectionAny animated:YES];
```

### Creating custom activities

TO DO

## Customization

TO DO

## Known Issues

* REActivityViewController doesn't support landscape orientation on iPhone, so you'll need to lock your presenting view controller in portrait orientation.
